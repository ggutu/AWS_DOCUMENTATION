SNS topic :when transmited over the wire encrypted.
if highly sensitiveve.You want have higher standerd.Bith on the wire and rest
Iaas:
===
Here the cloud service providers offer databases,web servers ,application servers,
messageing services,network,and more to their customers as a service,
and customers pay them as per use.
Paas:
===
-platform as service --->provide customer on demand Enviroment for testing developing ,and delivering applications(code) in the cloud.
It providees development tools.For example application server(jeva,Net framework)and Database server(mySQL,ORacle)
It makes it easy developers to quickely create web or mobile applicatios and deliver them to the market
eg.Elastic Beanstalk,Goole App Engine.

SaaS:
===
It delivers the software applications over the internate ,on demand and subscributions.
cloud providers manage software applications ,underlying infrastructure plus handle software updates and security patches.
user connect the software applications via a browser,pc or mobile 
example .online banking service,gmail,facebook,github,office365
Cloud :
Pros:
cost-effective,scalable ,flexable ,availablity,
Cons:Low security and less cotomizable,lack of total control,not easy to migrate.

AWS -175 services across infrastructure as a service(SaaS).
Client security is a significant concern for Aws.

security is inhrint in my organizations.

How choose the region 
========================
-security and compliance requirment 
-Service aviablity (some service are not 
-pricing 
-User/customer location
-latency
==================================================
-Data present in region can be replicated to a different region to mantain the data's availablity at time of failure.
(az1 az2 az3).
-increase fault tolerance 
- Redundancy 
-reduces Latency 
===================================
HA 
user deploy their server at least in two Az's that cases 
one Az goes down the applications can continue to function smothly by using the other Az
-High Avialablity ensure fault tolarance and low latency and low latency in a particular region.
==========================================================
Latency is measure of time require for transfer of data from client to server and back to the client.
Latency=T1+T2
